P.M.B. Iteration 2
Project Plan: 
Under one website, there will be 3 different sections(links)that will consist of 
our generated art graphics along with a description of what the art represents. 
The website will be a representation of a mini portfolio that is shared amongst 
Page Powell, Maggie Nguyen and Bailey Stern. 

Description changes: 
- Creating main website (to showcase all three websites in one place)
- Adding personal artist paragraph 
- Including a link to personal artists websites 


Page Powell paragraph/description: 
<p>
Hi! My name is Page Powell and I am a senior Creative Computing major at SMU. 
For my final project I created my own website that talks a little bit about 
myself and the type of creative projects I create. There is an interactive aspect 
as well, which is created using the P5 library and Javascript. I utilized a 
combination of my design and coding skills to develop my website and its features. 

Check out the link below to visit the website and create your own generative art! 
Once you are on my website click in the empty space below to generate random shapes! 
Each time you mouse click anywhere on the screen, a random shape with a random color 
will appear. Use the A key to increase or D key to decrease the shape size. Have fun creating! 
</p>


Maggie Nguyen paragraph/description: 
<p>
Hello, my name is Maggie Nguyen and I am a third-year Creative Computation Major at SMU. 
As a creative, I focus on crafting projects that emphasize meaning, immersion, and 
interactivity. With my knowledge in Java, HTML, C++, and Python, I aim to create engaging 
graphics, driven by my interests in integrating code and creativity. 

Below is a link to my website which will lead to a generative graphic created using 
P5- an open-source JavaScript library, used for making art.
