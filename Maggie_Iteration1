Final Project: Iteration 1 Assignment 

Project Plan: 
Under one website, there will be 3 different sections(links)that will consist 
of our generated art graphics along with a description of what the art represents. 
The website will be a representation of a mini portfolio that is shared amongst 
Maggie Nguyen(myself), and my team members Bailey Stern and Page Powell.

Iteration 1 Plans: 
- I will have my personal link website 
- I will provide a short description of who I am 
- I will create my p5.js sketch file and link the p5.js library 
- I will include a digital graphic using p5 (generative factors will be included later on) 

Maggie's Website that will be added to Main Website: 
https://github.com/maggient/maggient.github.io
